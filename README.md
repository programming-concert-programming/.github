# Programming Concert Programming

"Programming Concert Programming" is a a proejct to provide 
computational resources for exploring the publicly accessible data
about concert programmes (US: programs).

- How do popular artists' setlists change over their career?
- What does it look like for a new piece to "enter the classical repertoire" - how many pieces have managed that in the last 100 years?

If questions like that interest you, then you came to the right place!

Watch this space for public releases (coming soon!) or get in touch to propose a colaboration.
